# pydentate

pydentate is a biophysically realistic computational model of the dentate gyrus, a hippocampal brain region associated with memory formation and a computation called pattern separation.  We made changes based on new literature and our own experimental findings. Furthermore, we introduced enhancements to study pattern separation.

# Installation
<ol>
<li><p>Open a terminal and clone the pydentate repository</p><blockquote>git clone https://github.com/danielmk/pydentate.git</blockquote></li>
<li><p>Inside the cloned repository pip install</p><blockquote>cd pydentate<br />pip install -e .</blockquote>ON WINDOWS: You will need to <a href="https://www.neuron.yale.edu/neuron/download">install neuron manually.</a></li>

  <li><p>The installation is now complete and you can get started by running the example script</p><blockquote>python paradigm_pattern_separation_baseline.py</blockquote>This will take a long time. If no errors are raised your pydentate is working.</li>
</ol>
